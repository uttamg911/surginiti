					<h1><span id="about">About</span></h1>
					<p>
						Laparoscopic surgery became popular because of less pain, faster recovery and small scars. The constraint in this type of surgery is that the surgeon's natural hand moments cannot be replicated with laparoscopic instruments. The pneumoperitoneum created for working space has some disadvantages like decreasing venous return to the heart and gas embolism.
					</p>
					<p>
						The above difficulties can be overcome by designing devices exploiting the special characters of Shape Memory Alloy like NiTiNOL.
					</p>
					<h1><span id="technology">Technology</span></h1>
					<p>
						<h2 style="font-size:200%; text-align:left;">Clip</h2>
					</p>
					<p>
						A clip is applied to the end of a bleeding vessel. The super memory alloy which is shaped like a 'U' without any gap between the limbs is heat treated (austenite phase). In the cool state (martensite phase), It can be made into a straight wire or 'U',introduced through narrow laparoscopic port and applied at the required site by applying heat. The limbs will come together in austenite phase thus occluding a bleeding vessel. It is held in place by body temperature.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h2 style="font-size:200%; text-align:left;">Space Maintaining Lattice</h2>
					</p>
					<p>
						The SMA wire can be customized into a shaped lattice to create a working space within the abdominal cavity taking care to accommodate solid organs like liver and spleen. It is heat treated in this shape. At room temperature it can be folded to reach required diameter of port size and introduced into the abdominal cavity by Hasson Open Technique. Austenite phase is achieved by applying electricity. At the end of surgery martensite phase is achieved by stopping electricity or cooled with liquid nitrogen.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h2 style="font-size:200%; text-align:left;">Hydra Instrument</h2>
					</p>
					<p>
						Surgeon hand moments are achieved by a device looking like coelenterate Hydra. Each tentacle has two insulated SMA wires and an electrical cable. One super elastic wire runs throughout the length of the tentacle. The other type of SMA is thermal memory wire utilized in the above two tools. Small segments of it are mechanically applied through insulating material to the super elastic wire and each segment is electrically connected. By generating heat in the required segment the tentacle can be bent to required shape and its tip can reach a required spot in the surgery. The tip can be fitted with different instruments like forceps, scissors, graspers etc and austenite & martensite phases can be achieved.
					</p>
					<p>
						A port is created by standard Hasson Open Technique. Space maintaining lattice is introduced in folded martensite phase. Either body temperature or diathermy application transforms it to expanded state thus stretching abdominal cavity in customized way and retracting solid organs like liver. Thus working space is created without the need for pneumoperitoneum. Two cameras are hanged from the Space maintaining lattice maintaining normal visual angle. Each camera transmits the same image at different angle to Google goggles with two images beaming into different eyes of the surgeon to produce a 3D image. Hydra instrument is then introduced and its tentacles are used for effecting surgery.
					</p>
					<p>
						Image recognition software can be utilized to recognize the structures like gallbladder,Vermiform appendix etc. Programs can be written for different surgeries and posted on internet. These programs can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Until such programs are developed surgeons can manipulate the tentacles by wireless sensors incorporated gloves.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h3 style="font-size: 150%; text-align:left">Advantages</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Very Affordable:</b> Surgeries performed using SurgNiTi devices are very affordable to everyone</li>
							<li><b>Ultra Portable:</b> Unlike others, SurgNiTi devices are compact and can be carried anywhere</li>
							<li><b>Game Changer:</b> Completely new surgical solutions for existing diseases can be invented</li>
							<li><b>Full Control:</b> Option to choose between fully automatic 'or' the manual mode</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						<h3 style="font-size: 150%; text-align:left">Considerations</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Extra care should be taken to the insulation and wiring to avoid unintended actions and damages</li>
							<li>Body safe insulation material should be used</li>
						</ul>
